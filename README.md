# Accuknox_ques01
This repository contains my response for problem asked by Accuknox at JIIT campus hiring
The approach is to store the data using class in c++ language
Then I take details of every eater and foodItems ordered
If the foodItem is already in order then it throws an error and ask to re-enter some other fooditemID
after this I try to find the top 3 most ordered fooditems using sorting technique
If food items ordered are less than 3 then It shows only ordered elements and a msg that show fooditems ordered are of less than 3 types.
